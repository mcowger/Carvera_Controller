# Carvera Controller Core Library

**UI-free CNC controller library for Carvera machines**

This repository contains a completely refactored, UI-free core library extracted from the community-developed Carvera Controller. The library provides all the essential CNC control functionality without any user interface dependencies.

## üéØ Purpose

This core library enables developers to:
- Build custom user interfaces for Carvera machines
- Create automated CNC control applications
- Integrate Carvera control into existing workflows
- Develop headless CNC operations

## üìö Documentation

For complete API documentation, examples, and usage guides, see:
**[üìñ CNC Core Library Documentation](README_CNC_CORE.md)**

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from cnc_controller import Controller, CONN_WIFI
from cnc_core import CNC

# Create instances
cnc = CNC()
controller = Controller(cnc)

# Connect and control
controller.connect("192.168.1.100:2222", CONN_WIFI)
controller.send_command("G28")  # Home
controller.send_command("G0 X10 Y10")  # Move
controller.disconnect()
```

## üèóÔ∏è Original Community Controller Features

The original UI-based community controller (now archived) included:
* **3-axis** and advanced **probing** UI screens for various geometries (**corners**, **axis**, **bore/pocket**, **angles**) for use with a [true 3D touch probe](https://www.instructables.com/Carvera-Touch-Probe-Modifications/) (not the included XYZ probe block)
* Options to **reduce** the **autolevel** probe **area** to avoid probing obstacles
* **Tooltip support** for user guidance with over 110 tips and counting
* **Background images** for bolt hole positions in probe/start screens; users can add their own too
* Support for setting/changing to **custom tool numbers** beyond 1-6
* Keyboard button based **jog movement** controls
* **No dial-home** back to Makera
* **Single portable binary** for Windows and Linux
* **Laser Safety** prompt to **remind** operators to put on **safety glasses**
* **Multiple developers** with their own **Carvera** machines _"drinking their own [software] champagne"_ daily and working to improve the machine's capabilities.
* Various **Quality-of-life** improvements:
   * **Controller config settings** (UI Density, screensaver disable, Allow MDI while machine running, virtual keyboard)
   * **Enclosure light** and **External Ouput** switch toggle in the center control panel
   * Machine **reconnect** functionality with stored last used **machine network address**
   * **Set Origin** Screen pre-populated with **current** offset values
   * **Collet Clamp/Unclamp** buttons in Tool Changer menu for the original Carvera
   * Better file browser **upload-and-select** workflow
   * **Previous** file browsing location is **reopened** and **previously** used locations stored to **quick access list**
   * **Greater speed/feed** override scaling range from **10%** and up to **300%**
   * **Improved** 3D gcode visualisations, including **correct rendering** of movements around the **A axis**


## üîß Installation

### As a Python Package

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mcowger/Carvera_Controller.git
cd Carvera_Controller

# Switch to the core library branch
git checkout mcowger/NoMoKivy

# Try the example
python example_usage.py
```

### Using Poetry

```bash

## üß™ Testing

The library includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Or with pytest
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 59 unit tests covering all core functionality
- G-code parsing and validation

## üîå Integration

The core library is designed for easy integration:

```python
# Basic CNC operations
from cnc_core import CNC
cnc = CNC()
coordinates = cnc.parse_line("G1 X10 Y20 F1000", 1)

# Machine communication
from cnc_controller import Controller
controller = Controller()
controller.connect("192.168.1.100:2222")

# Utility functions
from cnc_utils import validate_gcode_line, parse_coordinate_string
is_valid = validate_gcode_line("G0 X10 Y20")
coords = parse_coordinate_string("X10.5 Y20.3 Z5.0")
```
